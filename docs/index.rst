   contain the root `toctree` directive.

SERPENT PROJECT
===============

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

The goal is to implement a python scriptset for editing maps like CentrED,
but more dynamic in it's housing.

Basically the first goal is to implement all kinds of tools to help a 
transition from the UO we have to a UO which takes us further by enabling
approaches of usability design to this very old engine.

The project will consist of:
    * concept - Playground for experimentation.
    
    * uolib1 - a library written mainly in python, which I used to manipulate
    UO data files for bugfixing, restructuring or cleaning up.
    Also I experimented with how to speed up python to nearly acceptable levels.
    My first UOLib was written in Pascal from scratch in 2000. 
    However, if you search a Pascal UO Engine, you might refer to the CentrED
    repository of Andreas Schneider, or to Alazanes InsideUO.
    For .net users there is one at RunUO.
    
    * uolib - if I have time to remodel uolib into a more organized format.
    
    * glue - the GL using editor.
