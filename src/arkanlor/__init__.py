"""
    Arkanlor is an attempt to create a world building server environment
    which supports Iris2 (or with time even legacy uo clients)
    and could potentially also be used to extend it to a complete emulator
    
    Sublibraries:
     - uos: gemuo based twisted network code for uo protocol
     - ced: twisted network code for centred clients?
     
     Naming: Arkanlor is one of the old dragons in Weltenfall, literally
     called arcane light
     
     First milestone: server list and login, walking code with full ACK.
