Artifact based generation
#########################

MapBlocks have to get artifact support. An artifact map places local maxima
in itself, and connects to other mapblocks. It can represent ongoing paths,
setting of different terrain types, etc.

Artifact Concept
################

Artifacts are created in an artifact map. they however also possess the ability
to save their exit points on borders, and continue their work on neighbouring
mapblocks.

Ideas behind this are "drunken movement" paths, mountains that erect themselves
spots of snow or dirt, watersprings leading to rivers, roads or paths
or any other natural phenomenon.

Artifacts however have preferences, means of start and end, and run as a separate
postprocessing step, instead of designing the basic layout of the terrain.

Item Definition Scripts
#######################

while reusing dragon is nice, more elaborate scripts could help define and update
datalists more casually.
