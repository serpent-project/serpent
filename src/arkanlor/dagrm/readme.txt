dagrm is a very simplicistic datagram tool, it defines a packet, which
can read and write its data - even async, endian complete, and so on,

if you search a similar product which is more feature complete, i recommend
http://construct.wikispaces.com/
https://github.com/construct/construct

dagrm has a slightly different approach, but basicly aims for the same. 
would i have known construct before, dagrm wouldnt have been born.
