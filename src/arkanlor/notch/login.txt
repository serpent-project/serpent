The recommended login sequence looks like this, where C is the client and S is the server:

Client connects to server
C->S 0x02 handshake
S->C 0xFD encryption request - server sends its public key and 4 random bytes
Client generates symmetric key (shared secret)
Client authenticates via session.minecraft.net
Client encrypts these 4 bytes with the servers public key.
C->S 0xFC encryption response - client encrypts shared secret with server's public key and sends along with encrypted 4 bytes
Server checks that the encrypted bytes match
Server decrypts shared secret with its private key
Server checks player authenticity via session.minecraft.net
S->C 0xFC encryption response - empty payload meaning two zero length byte arrays and two zero shorts
Server enables AES stream encryption
Client enables AES stream encryption
C->S 0xCD - Payload of 0 (byte)
S->C : Either kicks (invalid login) or sends a login response
S->C : Sends chunks and entities
S->C : Sends spawn position
S->C : Sends inventory [Need to verify this since inventory changed] (beta 1.1_02: looks like Window items with type=0, then a Set slot with window id = -1 and slot = -1)
S->C : Tell the client they're ready to spawn by sending a position + look packet. Note: The stance and Y should be swapped when the server sends it to the client (See Protocol Page)!
C->S : Sends a position + look packet to confirm the spawn position, with the stance and Y swapped back to the correct positions
