UO LIB
======

Basically this library should allow you to write arbitrary python code using
UO Files in any matter.

You should have granular access to maps, sprites, graphics, sounds and any
data file used.

However due to time constraints, I mostly focus on everything related to the
editor "glue".

Technologies from my uolib05 in concept and uolib1 should be combined, 
creating a common interface following certain guidelines.

These guidelines are to be written (and discussed) before any implementation.

In the end there should be one exact way to access the data, should be as 
pythonic as just possible, and allow other formats to be unified and born out 
of the code and concept.
